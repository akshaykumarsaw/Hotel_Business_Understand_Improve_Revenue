# Hotel Revenue Analysis - Milestone 3

## Forecasting Approach & Logic

To predict future demand, I implemented a forecasting model integrating historical trends with predictive analytics.

- **Forecasting Methodology**: I utilized booking data to generate predictive values (`yhat`) including upper and lower confidence intervals. These were imported into Power BI to visualize potential future occupancy.
- **Forecast Visualization**: The dashboard compares the **Actuals** against the **Forecasted Demand**, allowing for a direct comparison between realized performance and predicted targets.

## Cancellation & No-Show Analysis

To understand revenue leakage, I created specific visuals to track guests who cancel or fail to arrive.

**Cancellation Rate**: I calculated this metric to track the percentage of total bookings that result in a cancellation, helping to identify retention issues.

```DAX
DIVIDE([Total Cancellations], [Total Bookings], 0)
```

**No-Show Trends**: I created a dedicated line chart to track the volume of **No-Shows** over time. This visual helps identify specific days or seasons where guests frequently fail to check in without cancelling, indicating "wasted inventory" that could have been resold.

## Key Insights and Business Implications

From the forecasting and cancellation analysis:

1. **Future Demand Peaks**: The forecast indicates specific upcoming periods where booking volume is predicted to exceed the moving average. These periods require proactive **staffing adjustments** and **inventory management** to prevent service bottlenecks.
2. **Cancellation Behavior**: Fluctuations in the **Cancellation Rate** correlate with specific seasonal shifts. High cancellation periods suggest a need to review **non-refundable rate policies** or implement stricter deposit rules during peak seasons.
3. **Revenue Leakage Source**: The **No-Show** analysis highlights patterns of wasted inventory. Identifying these trends allows the management to consider overbooking strategies or pre-arrival confirmation checks during high-risk periods.
